## Installation

### From Release Section

You can download pre-compiled binaries from the [Release Section](https://github.com/XNM1/weather-rs/releases).

### Using Cargo Package Manager

1. Install Rust and Cargo from the official website: [Rust Installation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).
2. Run the following command to install and compile `weather-rs`:

   ```bash
   cargo install weather-rs --git 'https://github.com/XNM1/weather-rs'
   ```

3. Add the `.cargo/bin` directory to your PATH environment variable in your shell or use it directly from the `.cargo/bin` directory.

   - **Fish Shell:**
     ```fish
     set -gx PATH $HOME/.cargo/bin $PATH
     ```

   - **Bash or Zsh:**
     ```bash
     export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
     ```
     
   You can use the following commands in the shell for one-time use. Alternatively, you can set them in the appropriate shell configuration file to ensure they persist even after a shell restart. You can now use Cargo binaries seamlessly from the command line without specifying the full path to the `.cargo/bin` directory.

### For Nix Package Manager and NixOS

1. Clone the project from GitHub using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XNM1/weather-rs

### From Source

1. Clone the project from GitHub using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone 'https://github.com/XNM1/weather-rs'
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned project folder and build the project with the following command:

## Usage

```plaintext
Fast and simple CLI tool for weather data fetching from different providers

Usage: weather-rs <COMMAND>

Commands:
  provider-list    Get a full list of supported providers
  configure        Configure a provider with the given credentials
  select-provider  Select an available provider

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```

1. Check available weather provider APIs using the command:

   ```bash
   weather-rs provider-list
   ```

2. Configure weather providers using the command:

   ```bash
   weather-rs configure <PROVIDER> <API_KEY> [-u <URL>]
   ```

   Example: 

   ```bash
   weather-rs configure 'open-weather' '<your api key>'
   ```

3. Select a provider using the command:

   ```bash
   weather-rs select-provider <PROVIDER>
   ```

   Example: 

   ```bash
   weather-rs select-provider 'weather-api'
   ```

4. Get information about weather data using the command:

   ```bash
   weather-rs get <ADDRESS> [-d <DATE>] [--json] [-p <PROVIDER>]
   ```

   Example: 

   ```bash
   weather-rs get 'London'
   ```

   Another example: 

   ```bash
   weather-rs get 'London' -d '2023-10-11' --json
   ```

## Configuration

The configuration file is located in the following directories:

- Linux: `~/.config/weather-rs/config.toml`
- MacOS: `~/Library/Preferences/weather-rs/config.toml`
- Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\weather-rs\config\config.toml`

The configuration file is in TOML format and includes settings for services (URL and API key). For example:

```toml
[open_weather]
url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather'
api_key = 'your_api_key_here'
```

You can also set the selected main weather data provider in the `selected_provider` parameter. Example:

```toml
selected_provider = 'OpenWeather'
```

Please note that the selected provider should be in PascalCase in configuration file and in kebab-case when set from the command line (e.g., `weather-rs select-provider 'open-weather'`).
